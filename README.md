**BCTreeMap** is a class that implements a red black tree, providing similar functionality and time complexity as std::map

**BCTreeSet** is a class that implements a red black tree, providing similar functinoality and time complexity as std::set

To run the tests I have written for BCTreeMap, compile and execute Map.cpp

To run the tests I have written for BCTreeSet, compile and execute Set.cpp

If you would like to use or test out BCTreeMap or BCTreeSet make sure to #include "BCTreeMap.h" or #include "BCTreeSet.h", respectively.
